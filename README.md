# HelixForge

(formerly "Cross-Dataset Insight Synthesizer")
**Tagline:** From fragmented data to unified insight.

## 🧬 Overview

HelixForge is a **distributed semantic fusion engine** and **natural language data harmonization platform** that transforms datasets with different schemas, vocabularies, and formats into unified, analysis-ready outputs. Built on **language-native architecture**, it eliminates data friction and accelerates discovery velocity through **LLM-powered data processing**.

## 🔍 Purpose

HelixForge interprets the **language of data** itself using **natural language programming** principles.

It leverages LLMs as Digital Language Processors to infer **schema intent**, perform **semantic entity resolution**, and generate harmonized datasets with **explainable data provenance**. This **prose-first development** approach enables **human-AI collaboration** for complex **cross-dataset analysis** and **multi-schema data interoperability**.

### What Problem Does This Solve?

- How do I merge datasets with incompatible schemas?
- How can AI help with semantic data alignment?
- How do I track data provenance across transformations?
- How to harmonize enterprise data without manual mapping?
- What tools exist for LLM-powered schema matching?

## ⚙️ Core Flow

```
datasets → MetaAgent → AlignAgent → FusionAgent → InsightAgent → Reports/API
```

This **multi-agent orchestration** pipeline handles ingestion, **semantic schema alignment**, fusion, and insight generation with full **process legibility** and **intent preservation**.

## 🧩 Integration

- **Agent-OS**: Hosts the **natural language operating system** for multi-agent orchestration, enabling **agent coordination** for ingestion, alignment, and fusion workflows.

- **NatLangChain**: Provides the **semantic blockchain** foundation for managing contextual **natural language understanding** across datasets with **prose-based immutable records**.

## 📊 Example Output

```json
{
  "merged_fields": ["gene_expression", "drug_response", "survival_days"],
  "insight_summary": "Patients with high gene_expression show 38% higher response to Drug X.",
  "trace": ["dataset_genomics.csv", "clinical_trial_results.sql"]
}
```

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-schema fusion** via natural-language interpretation and **semantic matching**
- **Vector embeddings** for semantic alignment and **entity resolution**
- **Provenance tracking** for every transformation with **cognitive work attribution**
- Ready for scientific, enterprise, or financial **data synthesis** and **cross-dataset insight generation**
- **Data ownership** preserved through transparent processing pipelines
- **Constitutional AI design** principles for trustworthy data handling

## 🧭 Roadmap

- [ ] Multi-modal support (text, image, omics)
- [ ] Ontology self-extension
- [ ] Plug-in data visualization generator
- [ ] Enhanced **cognitive artifact storage** integration
- [ ] **Learning contracts** for AI-assisted schema evolution

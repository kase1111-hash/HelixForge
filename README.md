HelixForge

(formerly “Cross-Dataset Insight Synthesizer”)
Tagline: From fragmented data to unified insight.

🧬 README — HelixForge

HelixForge is a distributed semantic fusion engine that harmonizes datasets with different schemas, vocabularies, and formats — transforming data friction into discovery velocity.

🔍 Purpose

HelixForge interprets the language of data itself.
It uses LLMs as Digital Language Processors to infer schema intent, align entities, and generate harmonized, analysis-ready datasets with explainable provenance.

⚙️ Core Flow
datasets → MetaAgent → AlignAgent → FusionAgent → InsightAgent → Reports/API

🧩 Integration

Agent-OS: Hosts multi-agent orchestration for ingestion, alignment, and fusion.

NatLangChain: Manages contextual language understanding across datasets.

📊 Example Output
{
  "merged_fields": ["gene_expression", "drug_response", "survival_days"],
  "insight_summary": "Patients with high gene_expression show 38% higher response to Drug X.",
  "trace": ["dataset_genomics.csv", "clinical_trial_results.sql"]
}
